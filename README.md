# Tracker

Thinking Minds Tracker is a flexible, cost-effective, and low-power IoT device with integrated GNSS & LTE
connectivity, whose purpose is to make the latest IoT technology available where it is required, which for
economic or complexity reasons it is not accessible.

This device is the result of long research and extensive interdisciplinary development carried out as an
academical project.

## Features

- Integrated GNSS & LTE antennas with switchable external antennas.
- High energetic efficiency, providing it a long battery life (~1 year on a single charge).
- Extremely small size (60x35mm).
- Low production cost (~30 USD per device), whereas other comparable devices cost more than 100 USD per unit.
- Low operating cost (~0.2 USD per month).
- Great flexibility for multiple use cases: industrial, logistics, regulatory and for the general public.
